  "arguments": [
    {
      "claim": "Hell is too harsh — eternal fire is not just.",
      "counter": "Allah’s justice is perfect. Hell is not arbitrary but the natural outcome of persistent rebellion against truth. Those who knowingly reject guidance after clear signs have chosen their path.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 4:40 — 'Indeed, Allah does not wrong [even] as much as an atom’s weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.'",
      "scholar": "Ibn Taymiyyah: 'The punishment of Hell is in proportion to sins, and eternal Hell is only for the arrogant deniers who never repent.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Why would a merciful God create Hell at all?",
      "counter": "Mercy does not cancel justice. Allah is both Al-Rahman (Most Merciful) and Al-Adl (Most Just). Without Hell, tyranny and evil would go unchecked. Paradise without Hell would make no sense, as choice would lose meaning.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 15:49-50 — 'Inform My servants that it is I who am the Forgiving, the Merciful, and that My punishment is the painful punishment.'",
      "scholar": "Al-Ghazali: 'Mercy without justice is chaos, and justice without mercy is cruelty. Allah’s balance is beyond human comprehension.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Why eternal punishment for temporary sins?",
      "counter": "Hell is eternal only for those who eternally deny truth until death. For many sinners, punishment is temporary. Moreover, disbelief is not a mere 'temporary act' but a conscious, lifelong rejection of divine mercy.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 2:39 — 'But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs – they will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.'",
      "scholar": "Ibn Qayyim: 'The eternity of Hell for disbelievers is due to the eternity of their arrogance and denial, not the temporary nature of actions.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "A loving God would forgive everyone, even disbelievers.",
      "counter": "Forgiveness requires repentance. A just judge does not free an unrepentant murderer just because he is 'loving.' Allah opens the doors of repentance until the last breath, but those who reject Him reject His forgiveness.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 39:53 — 'Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves: Do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'",
      "scholar": "Imam Nawawi: 'Allah’s forgiveness encompasses all who turn to Him sincerely, but He does not wrongfully impose forgiveness on those who mock His signs.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Why would God care about belief? Isn’t good action enough?",
      "counter": "Actions without faith are like a house without foundation. Belief gives actions purpose and direction. Otherwise, morality is subjective and collapses when tested. Islam emphasizes both faith and deeds.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 103:1-3 — 'By time, indeed, mankind is in loss, except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.'",
      "scholar": "Imam Al-Shafi‘i: 'If Allah had revealed only Surah Al-Asr, it would suffice to prove the necessity of faith and righteous action together.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Hell is fear-mongering to control people.",
      "counter": "Hell is not manipulation; it is truth revealed. Just as warnings about disease or fire are not fear tactics but reality checks, so too are Allah’s warnings. The Qur’an uses balance: hope of Paradise and fear of Hell.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 32:21 — 'And We will surely let them taste the nearer punishment short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will repent.'",
      "scholar": "Ibn Kathir: 'Warnings are mercy, not tyranny. A warning is only cruelty if it is false — but Allah speaks only truth.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Why are some people born Muslim and others not? That seems unfair.",
      "counter": "Every person is born on the fitrah (natural disposition to recognize God). Everyone is tested according to their circumstances. Islam teaches that those who never truly received the message will not be judged unfairly.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 17:15 — 'And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger.'",
      "scholar": "Ibn Taymiyyah: 'Allah’s justice guarantees that no soul is punished without knowledge. The test is tailored to each individual’s circumstances.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "If Paradise is eternal bliss, won’t it become boring?",
      "counter": "Paradise is not static but ever-increasing joy. Allah continuously renews blessings, unveils new beauty, and elevates His servants. Human imagination cannot grasp its endless variety.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 50:35 — 'There they will have whatever they wish, and with Us is more.'",
      "scholar": "Ibn Abbas: 'Even the smallest gift in Paradise surpasses the imagination of mankind.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Why does God reward faith with physical pleasures in Paradise?",
      "counter": "Paradise is not just physical — it is also spiritual: nearness to Allah, eternal peace, joy beyond description. The physical pleasures are metaphors and incentives for human understanding.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 32:17 — 'No soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort for eyes as reward for what they used to do.'",
      "scholar": "Imam Ibn Qudamah: 'The greatest delight in Paradise is seeing Allah — everything else is secondary.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Why doesn’t Allah just put everyone in Paradise from the start?",
      "counter": "Life is a test of sincerity and free will. Paradise is a reward for effort, not entitlement. Without accountability, life would be meaningless, and Paradise would lose its value.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 67:2 — 'He who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed — and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving.'",
      "scholar": "Al-Hasan Al-Basri: 'This world is the field; the harvest is in the Hereafter. No one reaps without sowing.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Why is Shirk (associating partners with Allah) considered unforgivable?",
      "counter": "Shirk is not just a mistake — it is rejecting the essence of truth: Allah’s Oneness. It is like denying the sun while standing in its light. Shirk corrupts all good deeds as it breaks the foundation of belief.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 4:48 — 'Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills.'",
      "scholar": "Imam Ibn Kathir: 'Shirk is the gravest injustice — giving the right of the Creator to the creation.'"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Why would God threaten people instead of guiding all directly?",
      "counter": "Allah has sent guidance to every nation through prophets. Threats are warnings, not oppression. Just as parents warn children for their safety, Allah warns humanity for ultimate success.",
      "reference": "Qur’an 16:36 — 'And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], ‘Worship Allah and avoid Taghut (false gods).’'",
      "scholar": "Imam Tabari: 'Warnings and glad tidings are part of divine wisdom. Without them, humans would become heedless.'"
